# Link Collection on Humanitarian AI

For now, this is just a list of interesting links, I will be maintaining and updating this file as I learn more about this subfield of data science.

Happy reading, don't forget to check back for updates soon and don't forget to be awesome!

## Open Source Projects

The great thing about open source projects is they can be used for a very bottom up design approach. Politically, I believe in self-organization, DIY,
mutual aid, and freely sharing resources and information that help everyone make their lives and technology better. This is close to what some would call anarchist,
and I do believe the way open source projects are originally conceived of is very compatible with this. For me, in practice it means ensuring not just the 
participation, but the self-governing role of the target user audience in the creation process. This applies not only to technology, but to all intervention that affect people.

The organization "Humanitarian AI" is still new to me, but so far lies the closest to this way of working and approaching the creation of technologies and solutions. They're website also links to open source resources.

## Big Player Projects

The following links are themed towards the more big, institutional top-down actors in humanitarian AI. They may prove interesting to follow up on and get to know. Often the vision documents from the UN, like the article "From big data to humanitarian-in-the-loop algorithms," are rich in ideas and insights that may inspire you to develop your own vision.

### NGO's

This is a section for NGO-related links in the theme of humanitarian AI.

### United Nations

The United Nations takes a special place in the realm of humanitarian organizations. More context will be added soon.

### Companies and other filanthropist big guys

This section will include links connected to commercial organizations and funds and foundations grown out of big fortune initiatives. They are not quite my cup of tea, but it's good to know what's out there.
