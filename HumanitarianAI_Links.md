# Link Collection on Humanitarian AI

For now, this is just a list of interesting links, I will be maintaining and updating this file as I learn more about this subfield of data science.

The first link is a warmly recommended article that goes into the co√∂perative context of applying AI in the real world, with the humanitarian applications as focus.

Happy reading!
